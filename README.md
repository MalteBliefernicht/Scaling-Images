# Scaling-Images

simple app that scales pictures up and down.
the purpose of this exercise was to find my own solution and meanwhile learn java basics.
the app calculates the dimensions of the scaled image and then loops through the pixels of that image.
for every pixel it calculates the surface this pixel would cover in the source image.
this way we get the coordinates of the covered pixels and to what percentage the pixels are covered.
with this data we can then mix the right color for the pixel of the scaled image.
